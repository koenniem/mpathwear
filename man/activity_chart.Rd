\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame containing the wearable data.}

\item{start}{The name of the column containing start timestamps. Defaults to \code{"start_time"}.}

\item{end}{The name of the column containing end timestamps. Defaults to \code{"end_time"}.}

\item{variable}{The name of the column containing variable names. Defaults to \code{"variable"}.}

\item{value}{The name of the column containing measurement values. Defaults to \code{"value"}.}

\item{tz_offset}{The name of the column containing timezone offsets. Defaults to \code{"tz_offset"}.}

\item{merged_bars}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), activities are shown as a single row per day.
If \code{FALSE}, activities are shown with vertical transitions between states.}
}
\value{
A \link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot2::ggplot} object displaying activity types over time.
}
\description{
Creates a visualization of activity types over time from wearable data. The chart can display
activities either as merged horizontal bars per day or as individual activity segments with
transitions.
