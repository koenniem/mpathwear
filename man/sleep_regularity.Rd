\title{Calculate sleep regularity index}
\usage{
sleep_regularity(
  .data,
  start = "start_time",
  end = "end_time",
  variable = "variable",
  tz_offset = "tz_offset"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame containing the wearable data, typically from \code{\link[=clean_dynamic_data]{clean_dynamic_data()}}.}

\item{start}{The name of the column containing start timestamps. Defaults to \code{"start_time"}.}

\item{end}{The name of the column containing end timestamps. Defaults to \code{"end_time"}.}

\item{variable}{The name of the column containing variable names. Defaults to \code{"variable"}.}

\item{tz_offset}{The name of the column containing timezone offsets. Defaults to \code{"tz_offset"}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the \code{sleep_regularity} score (ranging from -100 to 100, where
100 indicates perfect regularity).
}
\description{
Calculates the Sleep Regularity Index (SRI), which describes the likelihood that any two
time-points 24 hours apart were in the same sleep/wake state across all days. This is a
well-established indicator of sleep consistency.
}
\details{
Values below 60\% are associated with a significantly higher likelihood for Alzheimer's
disease, depression, and cardiovascular diseases.
}
\note{
This function requires the \code{mpathsenser} package to be installed.
