NOTE: This package is highly experimental and still in early development. 

The goal of mpathwear is to help users import wearable data gathered through m-Path. Importantly, it helps unpack the exported CSV file from m-Path and neatly sorts it into intraday and daily data where the measurement IDs are converted to a human readable format.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mpathwear from Github:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("koenniem/mpathwear")
```

# Reference 
For an overview of all functions in this package, see the [mpathwear Reference Site](https://koenniem.github.io/mpathwear/). For other m-Path related data, see [mpathr](https://github.com/m-path-io/mpathr) for regular m-Path questionnaire data, and [mpathsenser](https://github.com/koenniem/mpathsenser) for m-Path sensor data.
