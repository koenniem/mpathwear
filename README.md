NOTE: This package is highly experimental and still in early
development.

The goal of mpathwear is to help users import wearable data gathered
through m-Path. Importantly, it helps unpack the exported CSV file from
m-Path and neatly sorts it into intraday and daily data where the
measurement IDs are converted to a human readable format.
